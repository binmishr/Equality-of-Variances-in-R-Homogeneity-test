# Equality-of-Variances-in-R-Homogeneity-test

Equality of Variances in R, in this article, we are describing variance comparison of 2 or more samples.
There are different types of tests that can be utilized to assess the equality of variances.

1) F-test:- Used for two groups variance comparison. Data must be normally distributed.
2) Bartlett’s test:- Used for two or more groups variance comparison. Data must be normally distributed.
3) Levene’s test:- An alternative to Bartlett’s test for non-normally distributed data.
4) Fligner-Killeen’s test:- A non-parametric test for non-normal data.
